A brain tumor detection system leverages advanced imaging techniques and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and diagnose brain tumors. Utilizing MRI and CT scans, the system processes high-resolution images to detect abnormalities.
AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models, analyze these images to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors with high accuracy. These systems enhance early detection, enabling timely medical intervention, and improving patient outcomes.
Integration of AI reduces diagnostic errors and supports radiologists by providing detailed analysis, thus streamlining the diagnostic process and potentially reducing the need for invasive biopsy procedures. Continuous advancements in this technology promise even greater precision and reliability in the future.
